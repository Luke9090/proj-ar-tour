  text: `This Grade II listed building was constructed as a public hall (1853 – 1856) on the site of the Peterloo Massacre and became a concert hall and home to the Halle Orchestra in 1858.
It was re-built following a direct hit during a blitz bombing campaign in 1940.
In the 1960s and 1970s it was home to two of the most talked about moments in Western popular music history.
On 17th May 1966, one member of a particularly disgruntled audience heckled Bob Dylan - ‘Judas!’ –  which was followed by ensuing cheers from the crowd, after the folk artist abandoned his trademark folk acoustic guitar and went electric with full band… “I don’t believe you… you’re a liar!” Dylan retorted to the crowd, before turning to his band…  “Play loud!“.
Nearly exactly 10 years later, on 4th June 1976, local Manchester band The Buzzcocks put on a gig at the hall supporting an unknown band from London – known as ‘The Sex Pistols’.
This first Sex Pistols Manchester gig – pre-fame and pre-notoriety - was famously poorly attended, but for those who did attend - future members of Joy Division / New Order, The Fall, The Smiths, Magazine and Factory Records kingpins, label boss Tony Wilson and producer Martin Hannett – this signalled the start of the Punk era and was a catalyst for pretty much everything that happened in Manchester Music in the ensuing decades.
The Sex Pistols played the Free Trade Hall again just over a month later - on 20th July 1976 – this time to a packed out venue.`,
